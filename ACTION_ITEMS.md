## 🎨 YOUR ACTION ITEMS (3 SIMPLE STEPS)

### STEP 1: Add Project Images 🖼️

Place images in your `assets/images/` folder for:
- CODDS project
- NeuroFocus project  
- Low-Light Enhancement project
- Age & Gender Estimation project

**EASIEST WAY:** Rename your WhatsApp images:
```
WhatsApp Image 2026-02-08 at 9.55.41 AM.jpeg → project-1.jpg
WhatsApp Image 2026-02-08 at 9.55.43 AM.jpeg → project-2.jpg
WhatsApp Image 2026-02-08 at 9.55.41 AM (1).jpeg → project-3.jpg
WhatsApp Image 2026-02-08 at 9.55.43 AM (1).jpeg → project-4.jpg
```

**TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB:**
1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Click `assets/` → `images/`
3. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
4. Drag & drop your images
5. Click "Commit changes"

---

### STEP 2: Add Your Resume 📄

1. Find your resume PDF (or create one)
2. Save it in the `assets/` folder as: `Taran_Resume.pdf`
3. Update the link in `resume.html`:
   - Find: `<a href="assets/Taran_Resume.pdf" download class="btn btn-primary">`
   - This will make the "Download Resume" button work

**Upload same way as images** (GitHub → assets/ → Upload files)

---

### STEP 3: Push Changes to GitHub 🚀

After adding images and resume:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\admin\Desktop\taran portfolio"
git add .
git commit -m "Add project images and resume"
git push
```

**Then wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy!**

## 📋 OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS

### Add More Projects
If you have more AI/ML projects:
1. Add images to `assets/images/`
2. Update `projects.html` with new project cards
3. Push to GitHub

In `projects.html`, update to point to your actual GitHub repos:
```html
<a href="https://github.com/Taran-heera/YOUR-PROJECT-NAME">
```

### Customize About Section
Edit the about text in `index.html` to be even more personal:
- Add specific achievements
